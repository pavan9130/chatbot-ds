You:hi
Robo:Hello, thanks for asking
You:Why are Ensemble techniques more preferred than other classification models?
Robo:Firstly the ensemble techniques assure about the reliability of the accuracy. This however can also be achieved for non-ensemble techniques by employing various reliability techniques. One such popular technique is k-fold cross validation. Secondly, it's the way how intelligently the classifications are predicted in ensemble techniques.
You:yes
Robo:Good to know that
You:bye
Robo:Bye! take care..
